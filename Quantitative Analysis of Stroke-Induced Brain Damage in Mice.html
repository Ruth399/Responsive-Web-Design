            <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
            <p>
                
Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, creating significant personal, social, and economic burdens. Despite extensive research, effective treatments are limited, with thrombolytic therapy using rtPA being the only approved drug for acute ischemic stroke, applicable within a narrow time window. Preclinical stroke studies often assess treatment efficacy by comparing infarct sizes, utilising various methods such as MRI and histological staining. However, these techniques can introduce biases and inconsistencies.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>
                A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was induced in mice. Free floating coronal brain sections were obtained using a microtome, then mounted and stained with Cresyl Violet and ordered following the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Lesion areas were manually traced as ROIs using ImageJ. Oedema ratios and corrected infarct areas for each slice were calculated using pre-formatted Excel sheets. Data on each slice’s distance from bregma, infarct area, and ipsilateral area were input into GraphPad Prism for AUC analysis to determine the volumes of the ipsilateral hemisphere and infarct region.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                In the current study, the infarct volume was calculated and compared to previously obtained results from five other mice. The left panel of Figure 1 displays the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere and infarct region in square millimetres, measured at various distances from bregma. The right panel of Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of infarct volume as a percentage (obtained via AUC analysis) of the total brain volume; Table 1 also displays this information.
                The infarct volume I calculated is highlighted in pink in the distribution graph. It is apparent that this value is outside the standard deviation range of the previously obtained results. Specifically, while the average infarct volume of the other mice falls within a certain range, my calculated value is more than likely an outlier.

            <h2>Discussion and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                The results indicate that the calculated infarct volume for my sample is an outlier when compared to the distribution of infarct volumes in the other five mice. The highlighted pink data point in the right panel of Figure 1 shows a significantly higher percentage of infarct volume, which deviates from the standard deviation of the group.
                
                This discrepancy is likely attributable to technical errors in the experimental procedure. Possible sources of error include inaccuracies in mounting the brain sections and manual tracing of the stroke regions. These methodological issues could have led to an overestimation of the infarct size in my sample.
                
                This could be improved by employing more accurate methods of measurements, such as automated image analysis software that produce more consistent and reliable results.
